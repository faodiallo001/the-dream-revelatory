          <h2>1. What exactly does The Dream Revelator do?</h2>
          <p>
            The Dream Revelator offers <strong>individual dream interpretations</strong>
            based on traditional symbolic reading. You describe your dream, how you felt
            when you woke up, and optional context about your life. A unique written
            interpretation is then created and displayed on the site.
          </p>

          <h2>2. Is this fortune telling?</h2>
          <p>
            No. The service does not predict the future and does not promise specific
            events. The focus is on <strong>symbolism, inner meaning and spiritual
            direction</strong>, not on fortune telling or guaranteed outcomes.
          </p>

          <h2>3. How much does one interpretation cost?</h2>
          <p>
            Each dream interpretation costs <strong>$3.99 (USD)</strong>. It is a
            one-time payment for a single reading. There are no subscriptions
            or recurring charges.
          </p>

          <h2>4. Will my dream be stored permanently?</h2>
          <p>
            No. To allow you to view and share your interpretation, it is stored
            temporarily for <strong>3 days</strong>. After that, the interpretation
            and related dream data are automatically deleted.
          </p>

          <h2>5. Do I need an account or email?</h2>
          <p>
            No account and no email are required to receive a reading. You complete
            the payment, view your interpretation on the site, and optionally share
            the link with someone you trust.
          </p>

          <h2>6. Can I share my dream interpretation?</h2>
          <p>
            Yes. After your reading appears, you will see an option to
            <strong>copy or share the link</strong>. Anyone with the link can view
            that interpretation during the 3-day availability period.
          </p>

          <h2>7. Is this psychological or religious counseling?</h2>
          <p>
            No. The interpretations are <strong>symbolic and spiritual in tone</strong>.
            They are not a substitute for medical, psychological, legal or financial
            advice. If you are facing serious difficulties, you should also seek
            appropriate professional support.
