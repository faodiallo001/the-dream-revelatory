          <p>
            Welcome to The Dream Revelator. By using this website and its dream
            interpretation service, you agree to the following terms.
          </p>

          <h2>1. Nature of the service</h2>
          <p>
            The Dream Revelator provides symbolic dream interpretations inspired by
            traditional approaches to dream analysis. These interpretations are for
            <strong>personal reflection only</strong>. They do not constitute psychological,
            medical, legal or financial advice and should not replace professional
            consultation where needed.
          </p>

          <h2>2. Use of the service</h2>
          <p>
            You may submit a dream for interpretation by providing descriptive
            information and completing a one-time payment. You agree not to submit
            content that:
          </p>
          <ul class="tdr-list">
            <li>contains illegal or abusive material;</li>
            <li>includes explicit or harmful content;</li>
            <li>violates the privacy, rights or safety of others.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The Dream Revelator reserves the right to refuse or remove submissions
            that breach these guidelines.
          </p>

          <h2>3. Payment and refunds</h2>
          <p>
            Each dream interpretation requires a one-time payment of
            <strong>$3.99 (USD)</strong>. Because each reading is individually generated
            from your description, payments are <strong>non-refundable</strong>, except
            where required by applicable law.
          </p>

          <h2>4. Availability of results</h2>
          <p>
            Your interpretation will be available through a unique link for
            <strong>3 days</strong> after it is created. After this period, the associated
            data is automatically deleted and cannot be restored.
          </p>

          <h2>5. Sharing</h2>
          <p>
            You may share your interpretation link at your own discretion. Anyone who
            has the link can access the content while it is available. You are
            responsible for deciding with whom you share it.
          </p>

          <h2>6. Service modifications</h2>
          <p>
            The Dream Revelator may update, modify or discontinue parts of the service
            at any time, with or without prior notice.
          </p>

          <h2>7. Limitation of liability</h2>
          <p>
            The Dream Revelator is not liable for any decisions, actions or outcomes
            that you choose based on an interpretation. The service is provided
            “as is”, without guarantees of uninterrupted access or specific results.
          </p>

          <h2>8. Governing law</h2>
          <p>
            These terms are governed by the laws applicable to digital services in
            the jurisdiction where the service is provided, subject to any mandatory
            consumer protection rules in your country.
          </p>
