      <p class="tdr-text">
        The Dream Revelator is a quiet, spiritual space dedicated to dream interpretation.
        It was created for people who feel that their dreams are more than random images
        – that they carry signs, warnings, blessings and inner messages.
      </p>

      <p class="tdr-text">
        Instead of offering quick, generic answers, the service focuses on
        <strong>symbolic, structured readings</strong>. Each interpretation is written
        individually, based on what you actually describe: the images you saw, the
        emotions you felt upon waking, and the context of your life.
      </p>

      <p class="tdr-text">
        The approach is inspired by <strong>ancient traditions of dream symbolism</strong>:
        the way older generations used to read dreams – as signs that can point to
        purification, inner conflicts, protection, hidden dangers, upcoming changes
        and spiritual openings.
      </p>

      <p class="tdr-text">
        No accounts, no subscriptions, no public sharing by default. You submit one dream,
        you receive one private reading on this site, and you decide whether you want to
        share it or keep it for yourself.
